Welcome to the Ham-Spam Classification project! This repository contains code for a machine learning model designed to classify emails as either "ham" (legitimate) or "spam" (unsolicited or malicious). Leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques, our model effectively processes textual data to discern between genuine and unwanted messages. With extensive training and evaluation, this system promises robust performance in filtering emails, enhancing communication efficiency, and bolstering security measures. Explore our codebase, contribute, and join us in combating email spam!
